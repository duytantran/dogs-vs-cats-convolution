# Classifying dog and cat pictures
We are given a huge dataset, which can be found from Kaggle, with dog and cat pictures. By applying the deep learning technique convolutional neural netowrks, we can seperate cats vs dogs. We are using 10'000 images to train a good model. We don't have any good rule of thumbs, but more images will give a better accuracy.

The CNN model, step by step:
* Step 1: Convolution
* Step 2: Max Pooling
* Step 3: Flattening
* Step 4: Full Connection

This can also be applied to more general problems, for instance classifying different brain tumors.
